1 · Purpose & Vision

We aim to deliver the world’s most accurate, inclusive, and sustainable online beauty experience.
Users will be able to:
	1.	Capture a selfie or short video.
	2.	Receive industry-leading, undertone-aware shade matches (target ΔE < 3 under typical mobile conditions).
	3.	Preview products instantly via client-side WebAR and (premium) personalised micro-videos.
	4.	Purchase with confidence, cutting returns and carbon waste.

After perfecting the experience on our own D2C site, we will license our SDK + ESG dashboard to third-party retailers.
